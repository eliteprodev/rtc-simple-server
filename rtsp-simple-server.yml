# Path options

# these settings are path-dependent.
# it's possible to use regular expressions by using a tilde as prefix.
# for example, "~^(test1|test2)$" will match both "test1" and "test2".
# for example, "~^prefix" will match all paths that start with "prefix".
# the settings under the path "all" are applied to all paths that do not match
# another entry.
paths:
  all:
    # source of the stream - this can be:
    # * record -> the stream is published by a RTSP or RTMP client
    # * rtsp://existing-url -> the stream is pulled from another RTSP server
    # * rtsps://existing-url -> the stream is pulled from another RTSP server
    # * rtmp://existing-url -> the stream is pulled from a RTMP server
    # * redirect -> the stream is provided by another path or server
    source: record

    # if the source is an RTSP URL, this is the protocol that will be used to
    # pull the stream. available options are "automatic", "udp", "tcp".
    # the tcp protocol can help to overcome the error "no UDP packets received recently".
